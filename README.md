# xmp-sharp

xmp-sharp is a wrapper for Adobe's [XMP Toolkit SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html) and will allow you to add, modify and/or delete XMP using any .NET 2.0 Application (ie. C#, VB.NET, etc.).
Currently, the antique version 4.1.1 of Adobe's SDK is wrapped.

It includes Adobe's XMP Toolkit SDK made available under the 3-clause BSD license.

xmp-sharp is a fork of [C# XMP Toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/csxmptk/), because
* The original project has not been updated since 2013-04-24.
* It is impossible to trace and contact the author of the original project.

## Alternatives
* [xmp-core-dotnet](https://github.com/drewnoakes/xmp-core-dotnet): Port of Adobe's SDK version 5.1.2 to managed C#. It lacks the schema classes and the XMPFiles project.
